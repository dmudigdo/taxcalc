# Handy Tax Calculator

Handy Tax Calculator currently does two common tax calculations:

*Tax Payable*: Calculates tax payable, given income. Calculations are based on the ([2018 Australian Tax Office rates](https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Individual-income-tax-rates/)).

*Date Difference Calculator*: Calculates the number of days (inclusive) between two dates. In taxation calculations, this is a common thing to look up, either from a table or from a website such as [timeanddate.com](http://timeanddate.com).

Written in Javascript/HTML, these handy tax calculators can be either accessed online or on your mobile device (see below), effectively making it a quick-and-dirty 'Mobile App'.

## Installation

## How to Put It on Your Android Device

On a desktop, installation is easy enough, as above. To put this on your Android device, download the files on this repository, then:

1. On your Android device's browser, navigate to `file:///sdcard`

2. Your browser will show the root files of your device. Navigate to the `index.html` file that you just downloaded.

3. Bookmark it to conveniently access in the future.

I have only tested this on my Android smartphone, there may be other ways to put it on other types of devices e.g. Apple devices.

## Background

Being currently in the middle of an [H & R Block income tax course](https://www.hrblock.com.au/income-tax-course), I found myself often looking up the above calculations mnaually. So this became a good maiden Javascript project, to learn and implement something that is personally useful and accessible from my smartphone (I previously wrote it in Python, requiring a desktop-bound Python interpreter).
